    working from home 
    since March 
    from my windowless den
    [pano without.jpeg]

    parked in front of my screen
    facing a wall
    [black.jpg]
   
    missing the office windows
    the natural scenery outside 
    brief serenity offered by the trees and sky
    between meeting rooms
    [Microsoft Windows.jpg]

    I wanted to recreate this feeling 
    create a scene beyond my wall
    A portal to transport me
    An augmented window in my office

    [AAMT.png]
    Not long after I started reading, I noticed something
    [masc.gif]
    the book used exclusively masculine words.
    Triggered, I immediately went to work, replacing the masculine words with feminine ones.

    I created a new version of the book, this time for women.

    Content with my handiwork, I was ready to declare victory and move on.
   
    And yet... 


    
    I felt I was missing something.
   
    I went to find out more about the author. 
    [wiki.gif]
    This book was written 100+ years ago in 1903?!
    I started to feel silly about my triggered reaction.

    Was I unfairly judging an old book through today's lens?

    
 
    I even found this quote from the author's wife:
    [quote.jpg]

    Perhaps I could've given the author the benefit of the doubt
    I dug deeper to see which words were attached to the masculine pronouns.

    The words seemed to be relevant to all people, not just men!

    And then I noticed it.

    I was originally triggered 
    because I felt excluded from the audience as a woman.

    And yet 
    my solution was also excluding others!

    So I tried again

The first assignment was to recreate a part of this painting, 
Dream City by Paul Klee in 1921
         [dreamcity.jpg]
    I chose this snippet of it
         [thumb.jpg]
and created this

For the second assignment, our task was to create an abstract greyscale pattern reflecting the structure of one of your favorite songs.
For this, I chose
